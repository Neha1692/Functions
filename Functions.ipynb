It's used to return the result of a function's operations.\n","\n","For examle: To add two numbers, we can use the return statement like this:\n","\n","  def add(x, y):\n","\n","      result = x + y\n","\n","      return result\n","\n"," # What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n","\n"," Ans:    iterator>> an iterator is an object representing a stream of data>>return the data one by one\n","\n"," An iterable is any python object/sequential structure/data structure that is capable of returning\n","its members one at a time\n","permitting it to be iterated over in a for loop\n","example>> list, tuples\n","\n","#6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n","\n","Ans- Generator functions in python are a way to create iterators in amore concise and memory-efficient manner.\n","\n","instead of using return to send a value back to the caller, a generator functiion uses 'yield'\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","def pw_generator():\n","     yield 1\n","     yield 2\n","     yield 3\n","\n","     generator = pw_generator()\n","\n","#What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n","\n","Ans- Memory efficiency: Generators are more memory efficient than regular functions because they only evaluate the code that is needed. This means that they don't need to store the entire sequence in memory at once.\n","\n","Lazy evaluation: Generators compute values only when they are needed, which can improve performance. This is called lazy evaluation.\n","\n","Speed: Generators can be faster than regular loops, especially when working with large data sets.\n","\n","Readability: Generators can make code easier to read and understand.\n","Represent infinite streams: Generators can represent an infinite stream of data because they produce only one item at a time.\n","\n","Easy to implement: Generators can be implemented in a clear and concise way.\n","\n","Simplified code: Generators can produce cleaner and more readable code, especially when dealing with complex data processing.\n","\n","#What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n","\n","ANs-A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function that's defined in a single line of code and used for short-term operations. The lambda keyword is used to define a lambda function, and the syntax is\n","\n"," lambda arguments: expression.\n","\n","# Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n","\n","Ans-Map in Python is a function that works as an iterator to return a result after applying a function to every item of an iterable (tuple, lists, etc.). It is used when you want to apply a single transformation function to all the iterable elements.\n","\n","# What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n","\n","Ans-Map Example: This function takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with each number squared. Filter Example: This function creates a new list of only even numbers from a list of integers. Reduce Example: This function computes the sum of a list of numbers, reducing them to a single total.\n","\n","# Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using  reduce function
